# Current and Renewal Economic Activities

## Summary
This document explores the concepts of current and renewal economic activities, their differences, and their importance in maintaining a company's competitive advantage. We'll examine these concepts through the lens of the Porter Value Chain and the V.R.I.N framework, with practical examples from major tech companies.

## Definitions and Important Concepts
- All activities generate  cost or a profit 
### Current Activities

Current activities are those that generate revenue for a company in the present or near future. These activities are typically focused on maintaining and growing existing customer relationships, managing day-to-day operations, and generating cash flow. Examples of current activities include:

* Sales and marketing
* Customer service and support
* Production and manufacturing
* Distribution and logistics
* Financial management and accounting

### Renewal Activities

Renewal activities, on the other hand, are those that help a company sustain its competitive position over time by investing in new technologies, processes, and relationships. These activities focus on maintaining or improving existing capabilities to stay ahead of competitors and adapt to changing market conditions. Examples of renewal activities include:

* Research and development (R&D)
* Process innovation
* Talent acquisition and development
* Strategic partnerships and collaborations
* Brand management and reputation building

**Key differences:**

1. **Focus**: Current activities focus on generating revenue, while renewal activities focus on sustaining a company's competitive position.
2. **Time horizon**: Current activities are typically short-term focused, while renewal activities have a longer time horizon (e.g., 3-5 years).
3. **Investment**: Renewal activities often require significant investments in new technologies, processes, and relationships.

By understanding the differences between current and renewal activities, organizations can allocate resources effectively to drive growth, improve competitiveness, and create long-term value for their stakeholders.

#### Porter Value Chain
![[Value chain theory.png]]

The Porter Value Chain is a framework for analyzing a company's competitive position by identifying its core processes and activities.
* **Definition**: The Porter Value Chain is a framework for analyzing a company's competitive position by identifying its core processes and activities.
* **Five Primary Stages**:
	1. Inbound Logistics
	2. Operations
	3. Outbound Logistics
	4. Marketing and Sales
	5. Service
* **Value Chain Process**: The Porter Value Chain involves transforming an input into a product or service through various stages.

#### V.R.I.N  
The V.R.I.N model is a framework used to analyze the value of resources in an organization. It was first introduced by Michael Porter and his colleagues.

V.R.I.N stands for:

* **V**: Value - The resource must have value to the organization.
* **R**: Rarity - The resource must be rare or scarce, meaning it cannot be easily replicated or substituted.
* **I**: Inimitability - The resource must be difficult to imitate or replicate, making it unique and valuable.
* **N**: Non-substitutability - The resource must be non-substitutable, meaning that there is no suitable substitute available.

In other words, a resource has V.R.I.N if it meets all four criteria:

1. It has value to the organization.
2. It is rare or scarce.
3. It is difficult to imitate or replicate.
4. There is no suitable substitute available.

By analyzing the V.R.I.N of resources, organizations can identify areas where they have a competitive advantage and focus their efforts on developing and maintaining those resources.

### Applying V.R.I.N to Tech Giants

| Company   | V.R.I.N Resource              | V                                | R                                | I                                | N                                |     |

## Revised Definitions and Concepts

## Management Theories

1. **Resource-Based View (RBV)**: Emphasizes the importance of internal resources and capabilities in achieving competitive advantage.
2. **Dynamic Capabilities**: Focuses on a firm's ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments.
3. **Disruptive Innovation**: Describes how small companies with fewer resources can challenge established businesses by addressing overlooked segments of the market.
4. **Blue Ocean Strategy**: Advocates creating uncontested market space (blue oceans) rather than competing in existing markets (red oceans).
5. **Ambidextrous Organization**: Suggests that successful companies can both exploit existing capabilities and explore new opportunities simultaneously.

## Practical Applications

1. **Strategic Planning**: Use the Porter Value Chain and V.R.I.N analysis to identify areas for improvement and investment.
2. **Resource Allocation**: Balance investments between current and renewal activities to ensure short-term profitability and long-term sustainability.
3. **Innovation Management**: Develop processes to foster both incremental improvements (current activities) and radical innovations (renewal activities).
4. **Competitive Analysis**: Use these frameworks to assess competitors and identify potential threats or opportunities in the market.
5. **Organizational Design**: Structure the company to support both current and renewal activities, possibly using an ambidextrous approach.

## Case Studies

1. **Apple's iPod and iPhone**: Illustrates how a company can use renewal activities (developing new product categories) to create new markets and revenue streams.
2. **Netflix's Transition to Streaming**: Demonstrates the importance of investing in renewal activities even when current activities are successful.
3. **Kodak's Failure to Adapt**: Shows the risks of focusing too heavily on current activities at the expense of renewal activities.

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding the Porter Value Chain is crucial for identifying areas where a company can optimize its current activities and invest in renewal activities.
- By analyzing the value chain, organizations can identify opportunities to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and create long-term value for their stakeholders.
- Balancing current and renewal activities is crucial for long-term success.
- V.R.I.N resources are key to sustaining competitive advantage.
- Successful companies continuously invest in both exploiting existing capabilities and exploring new opportunities.
- Adapting to changing market conditions often requires significant investment in renewal activities.
