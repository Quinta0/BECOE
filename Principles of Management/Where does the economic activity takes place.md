# Where does the economic activity takes place

## Summary
This lecture explores the question of where economic activity occurs, focusing on the roles of organizations and markets. It introduces Herbert Simon's thought experiment about how an alien might view Earth's economic landscape, emphasizing the dominance of organizations over market transactions. The lecture then delves into different types of organizations, their common elements, and the specific role of the State/Public Administration in economic activities.

## Definitions and Important Concepts
1. Organizations vs. Markets: Economic activity primarily occurs within organizations (green areas) rather than in market transactions (red lines), according to Herbert Simon's thought experiment.

2. Four major types of organizations:
   - Families
   - Firms
   - State/Public Administration
   - Non-profit organizations

3. Common elements of organizations:
   - Fundamental purpose
   - Stakeholders who are recipients of produced goods
   - Stakeholders who contribute production factors
   - Residual result and its destination

4. State/PA main areas of intervention:
   - Defense
   - Education
   - Healthcare
   - Justice
   - Public Safety
   - International Relations
   - Culture
   - Welfare
   - Public Goods

5. Cases when State/PA engage in economic activities:
   - Pure public goods
   - Natural monopolies
   - Negative externalities
   - Positive externalities
   - Incomplete markets
   - Information asymmetry
   - Merit goods
   - Wealth redistribution

6. Pure Public Goods:
   - Non-excludability
   - Non-rivalry

7. Free riding problem: Underprovision of public goods due to individuals benefiting without contributing.

8. Externalities: Costs or benefits not transmitted through prices and incurred by parties not involved in the transaction.

9. Non-profit organizations: Private organizations that cannot distribute net earnings and pursue social, cultural, educational, or political goals.

## Revised Definitions and Concepts
*Simplified and summarized Definitions and Important Concepts for later study*
## Management Theories
Herbert Simon's theory on the dominance of organizations in economic activity.

## Practical Applications
- Understanding the role of different types of organizations in economic activities
- Recognizing when state intervention is necessary in the economy
- Addressing market failures through public goods and services

## Case Studies
Herbert Simon's thought experiment: An alien observing Earth's economic landscape would see primarily green areas (organizations) connected by red lines (market transactions).

## Key Takeaways
- Economic activity primarily takes place within organizations rather than in markets.
- There are four major types of organizations: families, firms, state/PA, and non-profits.
- The state intervenes in economic activities for various reasons, including providing public goods and addressing market failures.
- Pure public goods are characterized by non-excludability and non-rivalry.
- Non-profit organizations play a crucial role in providing goods and services that may not be adequately supplied by the state or market.

## Questions for Further Thought
1. How has the advent of technology and the internet changed the landscape of economic activity as described by Herbert Simon?
2. What are the challenges in balancing the roles of organizations and markets in modern economies?
3. How do non-profit organizations contribute to addressing market failures and complementing state activities?
