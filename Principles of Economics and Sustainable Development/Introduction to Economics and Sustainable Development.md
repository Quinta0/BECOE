# Introduction to Economics and Sustainable Development
## Summary

This topic introduces the fundamental concepts of economics and sustainable development. It covers the definition and origins of economics, the concept of scarcity, and the evolving understanding of well-being beyond just economic measures. The topic also explores the limitations of GDP as a measure of societal progress and introduces alternative indicators of well-being and sustainability.

## Definitions and Important Concepts

- Economics: The study of how society uses scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them among people in a way that promotes the well-being of a society.
- Scarcity: Society has limited resources and therefore is unable to produce all the goods and services that people desire.
- Well-being (Welfare): A state of good health, serenity, happiness, good social relations, environmental quality, and prosperity.
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The market value of all final goods and services produced in a country over a given period of time.
- Sustainable Development: Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

## Revised Definitions and Concepts

- Economics: The study of resource allocation in society, considering not only current well-being but also sustainability for future generations and environmental constraints.
- Well-being: A multidimensional concept encompassing economic, social, and environmental factors, extending beyond mere financial prosperity.
- Sustainable Development: A holistic approach to societal progress that balances economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection for both present and future generations.
- Ecological Footprint: A measure of human demand on nature, representing the biologically productive area needed to provide for everything people use.
- Alternative Well-being Indicators: Metrics designed to provide a more comprehensive view of societal progress than GDP alone, often incorporating social and environmental factors.

## Economic Principles

- Efficient use of resources is important due to scarcity.
- GDP is not a perfect measure of well-being.
- There's a tendency to maximize GDP, which represents only a part of overall well-being.
- Alternative indicators of well-being have been proposed to address GDP limitations.

## Sustainability Aspects

- Consideration of natural resources in economic decisions.
- The concept of ecological footprint as a measure of human impact on the environment.
- Recognition of planetary boundaries and the need for economic activities to operate within these limits.

## Environmental Impact

- Discussion of global problems like climate change and local issues like air pollution.
- Consideration of biodiversity loss and its potential economic impacts.

## Social and Economic Implications

- Exploration of income and wealth inequality.
- Consideration of well-being beyond just economic measures, including social and environmental factors.

## Policy Considerations

- The importance of integrating sustainability considerations into economic policy-making.
- Examples of alternative well-being indicators being used in policy, such as Italy's Equitable and Sustainable Well-being (BES) indicators.

## Case Studies

- The implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a global framework for sustainable development.
- Italy's use of Equitable and Sustainable Well-being indicators in economic policy.

## Critical Thinking Questions

1. How can economic growth be balanced with environmental sustainability?
2. What are the limitations of GDP as a measure of societal well-being, and what alternatives might be more comprehensive?
3. How might policy-making change if it focused on maximizing well-being rather than just GDP growth?
